This project is a Music Recommendation System built using Flask and Machine Learning. 
It suggests the top 5 songs similar to a userâ€™s input based on features like view count, tags, channel name, and follower count.
The system uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to measure the similarity between songs.
The web app includes a simple HTML frontend with pages for user input and displaying personalized song recommendations.
